Use this template to create new prototypes in DWP. This template is updated with every major version release of the GOVUK prototype kit. 

Best practice:

Run npm audit regularly
Keep package-lock.json under version control
Do not blindly update packages without review
Never connect to internal APIs or production systems
Never store or process real user data
Remove old or unused prototypes promptly
Document the purpose and owner of each prototype clearly
Avoid turning prototypes into live services
Do not allow open write access to external collaborators
