<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Version three prototypes</h2>

<p><b>Please note:</b> This is a work in progress. Not all links below are active yet as we work through insights from the previous round of user research on version two prototypes. </p>
<p>The questions asked in the journey are based on the data capture requirements according to the latest versions of the relevant process maps / doc nodes.</p>
<p>All example content shown within the screens is based on GDS standards, style guidance and similar questions in other services. These are early drafts and will be iterated based on user evidence.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">In version three we have:</p>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>We have changed the name to ‘Tell DWP about a change’ to test a less specific name for comparison with the last round of UR (Tell DWP about a change of address / Report a change)</li>
  <li>We have iterated the start page to explain RaCO as the place to report general changes (not framed as change of address). We have also added new content to set expectations about other questions they may be asked, and added a Welsh translation link (requirement from private beta onwards)</li>
  <li>We have added an example knock out page ‘You cannot use this service’ for the radio option ‘my change is not listed’ on the change type page. This is to test whether this design helps users to understand what they can report in RaCO, and where to report other changes.</li>
  <li>We have iterated the tag labels to make the list and dependent tasks clearer. Research findings from the Nov 2025 round showed that some users thought they could complete the list in any order. We have added different tag labels like ‘cannot start yet’ based on GDS pattern to make this more explicit.</li>
  <li>We have iterated the address playback screen to make it clearer which address we are asking for. Research findings from the Nov 2025 round showed that users were confused by the design of this screen as they were unsure whether it referred to their previous or new address. We have based this iterated design on another example from Digital Channels that has tested well.</li>
  <li>We have added an interruption card screen to test whether it is helpful to set expectations around other questions we may ask. Research findings from NOV 2025 showed that some users felt that eligibility questions such as education were surprising or unexpected. This design is based on an MOJ pattern.</li>
  <li>We have iterated the evidence screens to:
 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>create an example with screens per evidence type</li>
  <li>create an example with one combined screen for all types</li>
  <li>add realistic evidence types taken from the DWP evidence standards</li>
  <li>add reassurance text to explain what the user should do if they do not have the evidence to hand or can’t upload it online. This example content is based on other similar evidence upload services including HMRC.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>We have iterated the confirmation page to:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>add example content about notifications such as email or SMS</li>
  <li>add example content to explain that citizens will be contacted if their claim needs to be reassessed</li>
  <li>terated the example timeframe (6-8 weeks) to test a shorter timeframe (2-4 weeks). In the Nov 2025 UR round, users felt 6-8 weeks was a long time so we want to test perceptions around something shorter. Accurate average timeframes have not been determined yet, so these are just examples.</li>
